## Learning Objectives

1. Understand basic JavaScript syntax and data types.
2. Learn about JavaScript objects and arrays.
3. Practice DOM manipulation using JavaScript.
4. Explore different function declaration styles.
5. Understand the concept of template literals for string interpolation.

## How to Use

1. Start by reviewing the `first.js` files in both Group01 and Group02 to understand basic JavaScript concepts.
2. Move on to the `page` folders to see how JavaScript interacts with HTML through the DOM.
3. Try modifying the JavaScript files to see how changes affect the web page behavior.
4. Experiment with the DOM manipulation examples in `dom.js` and `file.js`.
